<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> play a game with my friend <strong>so that</strong> we have fun.<br><br>
<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> quickly understand the rules <strong>so that </strong>we/I can be successful.<br><br>
<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> be able to easily click on a panda when it appears <strong>so that </strong>I can score points.<br><br>
<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> know how much time I have remaining <strong>so that </strong>I am not surprised when the game ends.<br><br>
<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> know my score <strong>so that</strong>I know how well I did playing the game.<br><br>
<strong>As a </strong>player, <strong>I want to</strong> know all these things while my opponent is playing<strong> so that</strong> I can anticipate a winner.<br><br>
